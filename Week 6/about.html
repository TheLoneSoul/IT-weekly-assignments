    <h1>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.
        <br> The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears.
         <br> This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. 
         <br> The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it.
          <br> A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. 
        <br> No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. </h1>
